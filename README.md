This is a mobile web app, meant to demonstrate development best practices as [recommended by the W3C](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/).
It's also an actual web app for black humor, which is available at [http://reallygood.co.il/jokes/](http://reallygood.co.il/jokes/)

Both jokes and documentation are in Hebrew to benefit Israeli web developers (and tact-less punks).

###Changelog

####0.1.1
- UI works exactly like in the mockup - iOS-like tab bar, awesome CSS3 buttons and more
- The app now uses [iScroll](http://cubiq.org/iscroll) for horizontal and vertical scrolling instead of our custom scrolling mechanism.
- Basic desktop (Chrome) support with mouse wheel & gestures

####0.1.0
- First release ever - After around 4 hours of coding, it kinda works but still has a long way to go.

**Note:** In its current state, the app supports mainly touch-based devices. We'll support other devices later on.
