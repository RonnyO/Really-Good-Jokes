This is an example mobile web app, meant to demonstrate development best practices as recommended by the W3C - http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/

It's also an actual web app for black humor, which is available at http://reallygood.co.il/jokes/

Both jokes and documentation are in Hebrew to benefit Israeli web developers (and tact-less punks).

Assumptions
---
In its current state, the app supports mainly touch-based devices.

Changelog

**0.1 alpha**
